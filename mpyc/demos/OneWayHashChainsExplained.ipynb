    "# Multiparty One-Way Hash Chains Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hash chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain) are well-known as a simple and efficient solution for asymmetric identification and authentication. They appear in many guises, often in contexts with severe performance constraints. For example, the [TESLA](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4082) scheme and friends use hash chains at their core and provide authentication in wireless sensor networks and satellite communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we construct an MPyC program for handling hash chains in a multiparty setting. There will be no single point of failure, as no single party will ever know the secret information from which the hash chains are built. This way of protecting secret keys is similar to what companies like [Sepior](https://sepior.com/) and [Unbound](https://github.com/unboundsecurity) do using threshold cryptography and MPC-based hardware security modules (HSMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hash Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-way **hash chain** of length $n$ is essentially a sequence of values $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$, satisfying $x_{i+1}=f(x_i)$, where $f:\\{0,1\\}^{128}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^{128}$ is a one-way function (128-bit security level, for concreteness).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) identification scheme** lets a prover generate a hash chain $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ with seed $x_0$ chosen uniformly at random in $\\{0,1\\}^{128}$. The prover registers $v=x_{n-1}$ with a verifier, after which the prover is set up to perform $n-1$ rounds of identification as follows. The first time the prover wishes to identify itself to the verifier it sends $x_{n-2}$; the verifier checks that $f(x_{n-2})=v$ holds. If so, identification succeeded and the verifier keeps $v=x_{n-2}$. The next time the prover will send $x_{n-3}$ to the verifier who checks $f(x_{n-3})=v$ and keeps $v=x_{n-3}$ upon success. And so on, until the prover sends $x_0$ in the last round of identification---at which point the hash chain is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamport identification is *asymmetric* in the sense that the information held by the verifier does not need to be kept secret. In other words, the initial value $v=x_{n-1}$ can be seen as the *public key* of the prover. The value $x_0$ is the corresponding *private key*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Multiparty One-Way Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking advantage of the MPyC [AES demo](https://github.com/lschoe/mpyc/blob/master/demos/aes.py), we obtain an MPyC program for a secure one-way function with almost no effort. "

    "Using function $f$, we will now generate one-way hash chains in a secure way, such that the initial seed value $x_0$ as well as all other values on the chain will be secret-shared when the program is run in a multiparty setting. Moreover, we will also traverse the so-generated hash chain in the reverse order, operating on secret-shared values throughout the entire process. \n",

    "The traversal of the hash chain in reverse corresponds to the way a hash chain is used in the Lamport identification scheme, first revealing $x_{n-1}$, then $x_{n-2}$, and so on, until $x_0$ is revealed at the end. To reverse one-way hash chain efficiently, we use algorithms for [optimal binary pebbling](https://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/pebbling/). This way, we will only use at most $\\lceil k/2\\rceil$ hashes (applications of $f$) in any identification round, while limiting the storage to $k+1$ hash values at any time. \n",

    "We basically copy the [Python code for binary pebbling](https://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/pebbling/src/python/BinaryPebbling.html), which makes judicious use of [Python generators](https://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#generators).
